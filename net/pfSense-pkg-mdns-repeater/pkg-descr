Forwards (re-broadcasts) mDNS packets across interfaces. 

mDNS is used in particular by Apple and other 'bonjour' based products,  for discovery purposes; this package will allow Apple Airplay, Apple printer discovery, and other Apple discovery to work across network segments and between subnets. Additional firewall rulesw are needed in addition; these must be entered in the usual way using the "rules" interface.
